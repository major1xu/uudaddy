The code can be run in the following environment, as a stand-alone Java SE project: 
Java SE 1.8
JUnit 5
Eclipse IDE

source is under "src" folder
JUnit test code is under "test" folder: the test cases mentioned in the requirements are included. 
Potentially, we can expand upon those cases.  

Please run test by clicking Test folder, then Run As "JUnit test"

MissingLetters: JUnit test 100% passed
Animation: JUnit test 50%v passed (need to handle the case of collision gracefully).
